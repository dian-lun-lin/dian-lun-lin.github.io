#### Short Biography
I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
My research interests focus on parallel computing and GPU computing using C++ and CUDA. 
During my recent three-year Ph.D. studies, I have published **three top-tier papers** (DAC 2023, ICPP 2022, and Euro-Par 2021) and one **top-tier journal** (IEEE TPDS 2022), all as the **first author**. 
I received **second place** in ACM/PACT Student Research Competeition (SRC 2022). I also received **champion award** in a research competition (IEEE HPEC Challenge 2020). 
I am a presenter at the CppCon 2023, CppNow 2023, and CppCon 2021. 
I also give talks at MediaTek Research, Berkeley National Lab, and NVIDIA Research. 
My recent work focuses on building a CPU-GPU task programming system using modern C++ Coroutine and CUDA.
