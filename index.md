#### Research Topic
Explore high-performance computing techniques to accelerate machine learning, electronic design automation, and other scientific computing applications using modern C++ and CUDA.
#### Short Biography
I am currently a Research Engineer at IBM and previously worked as a Research Engineer/Scientist at Intel Labs.
I earned my PhD from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in July 2024, 
with a focus on parallel computing and GPU computing using C++ and CUDA. 
During my PhD, I was the first author of five papers presented at top-tier conferences (DAC 2023 & 2024, Euro-Par 2024 & 2021, ICPP 2022) and one top-tier journal article (IEEE TPDS 2022). 
I received second place in the ACM/PACT Student Research Competition (SRC 2022) and won the champion award in the IEEE HPEC Challenge 2020. 
Additionally, I presented at leading conferences such as CppCon (2023, 2021) and CppNow 2023, and delivered invited talks at MediaTek Research, Berkeley National Lab, and NVIDIA Research.
