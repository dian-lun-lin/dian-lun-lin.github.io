#### Research Topic
Explore high-performance computing techniques to accelerate machine learning, electronic design automation, and other scientific computing applications using modern C++ and CUDA.
#### Short Biography
I received my PhD from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
My research interests focus on parallel computing and GPU computing using C++ and CUDA. 
During my PhD studies, I have published **five top-tier papers** (DAC 2023&2024, Euro-Par 2024&2021, ICPP 2022) and one **top-tier journal** (IEEE TPDS 2022), all as the **first author**. 
I received **second place** in ACM/PACT Student Research Competition (SRC 2022). I also received **champion award** in a research competition (IEEE HPEC Challenge 2020). 
I was a presenter at the CppCon 2023, CppNow 2023, and CppCon 2021. 
I also gave talks at MediaTek Research, Berkeley National Lab, and NVIDIA Research.
