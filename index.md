#### Short Biography
I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Utah.
During my recent two-year PhD studies, I have published **three top-tier papers** (one paper in ACM ICPP 2022 cooperated with NVIDIA Research, one paper in ACM/IEEE Euro-Par 2021, and one journal in IEEE TPDS 2022, all as the **first author**). I also received **champion award** in a research competition (IEEE HPEC Challenge 2020). I was a presenter in the biggest C++ conference (CppCon 2021). My recent work cooperated with **NVIDIA Research**, Gen-Fuzz, helps circuit desingers quickly and fully-automatically verify RTL designs on a high-thoroughput CPU-GPU platform.
