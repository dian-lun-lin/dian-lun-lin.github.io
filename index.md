#### Research Topic

#### Short Biography
I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Wisconsin Madison. 
My research interests focus on parallel computing and GPU computing using C++ and CUDA. 
During my recent three-year Ph.D. studies, I have published **four top-tier papers** (one paper in DAC 2023 cooperated with NVIDIA Research, one paper in ICPP 2022 cooperated with NVIDIA Research, one paper in Euro-Par 2021, and one journal in IEEE TPDS 2022, all as the **first author**). I received **second place** in ACM/PACT Student Research Competeition (SRC 2022). I also received **champion award** in a research competition (IEEE HPEC Challenge 2020). I was a presenter at the CppNow 2023 and CppCon 2021. I also gave talks at MediaTek Research, Berkeley National Lab, Nvidia Research, and several conferences such as ICPP, Euro-Par, and HPEC. My recent work focuses on building a CPU-GPU task programming system using modern C++ coroutine and CUDA.
