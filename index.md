#### Short Biography
I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Utah.
During my recent two-year PhD studies, I have published ***three top-tier papers*** (one paper in ACM/IEEE Euro-Par 2021, one paper in ACM ICPP 2022 cooperated with NVIDIA Research, and one journal in IEEE TPDS 2022, all as the first author). I also received ***champion award*** in a research competition (IEEE HPEC Challenge 2020). I was a presenter in the biggest C++ conference (CppCon 2021). My recent work cooperated with ***NVIDIA Research*** is planning to submit to the premier IEEE DAC 2023 (as the first author).
